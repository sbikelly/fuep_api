# FUEP Post-UTME Portal — Fresh Start Roadmap

This is a clean, realistic roadmap resetting all previous assumptions. Only the environment bootstrap done in this session is marked completed.

## Phase 0 — Environment Bootstrap ✅

- [x] Monorepo workspace scaffolding
  - [x] Root workspace config ([package.json](package.json))
  - [x] pnpm workspaces ([pnpm-workspace.yaml](pnpm-workspace.yaml))
  - [x] Base TS config ([tsconfig.base.json](tsconfig.base.json))
  - [x] Example env file ([.env.example](.env.example))
  - [x] Docker services ([docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml))
  - [x] Minimal DB schema seed ([infra/db/001_schema.sql](infra/db/001_schema.sql))
  - [x] Baseline ignore rules ([.gitignore](.gitignore))
- [x] Documentation reviewed and aligned
  - [x] Setup plan derived from ([README](README.md)) ([DevelopmentGuide.guide()](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md:1)) ([ArchitectureSpec.doc()](ARCHITECTURE.md:1)) ([Proposal.doc()](PROPOSAL.md:1))
- [x] OpenAPI contract added ([docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml))
- [x] Sequence diagrams added ([docs/sequence-diagrams.md](docs/sequence-diagrams.md))

Notes:

- Compose services include PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, MailHog.
- DB schema is a minimal bootstrap; extend per DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md when API modules take shape.

---

## Phase 0.5 — Docker Implementation & Containerization ✅

- [x] **Multi-stage Dockerfiles**: Created optimized Docker images for API and Web services
  - [x] API Dockerfile with Node.js runtime and TypeScript compilation
  - [x] Web Dockerfile with Vite build and Nginx serving
  - [x] Base stage with pnpm installation and workspace support
  - [x] Dependencies stage with types package building
  - [x] Build stage with application compilation
  - [x] Runtime stage with optimized images
- [x] **Docker Compose Orchestration**: Complete service orchestration
  - [x] API service with health checks and dependencies
  - [x] Web service with build args and environment variables
  - [x] Infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, MailHog)
  - [x] Service health checks and dependency management
  - [x] Port mapping and network configuration
- [x] **Workspace Integration**: pnpm monorepo support in Docker
  - [x] Types package building within Docker containers
  - [x] Shared dependencies and workspace linking
  - [x] Multi-stage builds with proper dependency copying
- [x] **Build Optimization**: Docker build improvements
  - [x] Comprehensive .dockerignore files
  - [x] Build context optimization for monorepo
  - [x] Layer caching and build efficiency
- [x] **Port Configuration**: Updated to match environment specifications
  - [x] Frontend accessible on http://localhost:5173 (as specified in .env files)
  - [x] Backend API on http://localhost:4000
  - [x] All infrastructure services properly mapped

**Known Issues Identified:**

- [x] **Environment Variable Substitution**: Frontend build process has issues with environment variable substitution during Docker build
  - [x] **Problem**: VITE_API_BASE_URL environment variable not properly substituted during Vite build
  - [x] **Impact**: Frontend uses hardcoded URLs instead of environment variables
  - [x] **Current Workaround**: Manual URL updates required after rebuilds
  - [x] **Investigation Status**: Multiple approaches attempted (build args, .env files, environment variables)
  - [x] **Solution Implemented**: Runtime configuration system with fallback logic
    - [x] HTML runtime configuration script with `window.APP_CONFIG`
    - [x] Config utility functions with priority: Runtime Config > Environment Variable > Default
    - [x] Null-safe functions to prevent toLowerCase errors
    - [x] Automatic fallback to Docker service names when running in containers

**Technical Details:**

- Docker build context set to root directory to handle pnpm workspace dependencies
- Multi-stage builds with separate dependency, build, and runtime stages
- Environment variables configured in docker-compose.yml and passed as build args
- Frontend served via Nginx on port 5173 (matching .env specifications)
- API service with CORS configured for localhost:5173

**Next Steps:**

1. Investigate and fix environment variable substitution issue
2. Implement proper runtime configuration if build-time substitution cannot be resolved
3. Document the final solution and update deployment procedures
4. Consider implementing health checks for frontend service
5. Optimize Docker image sizes and build times
