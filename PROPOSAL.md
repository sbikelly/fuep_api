# FUEP Post-UTME Portal - Project Proposal

## Executive Summary

The FUEP Post-UTME Portal is a comprehensive digital solution designed to streamline the post-UTME examination process for Federal University of Education, Pankshin (FUEP). This system modernizes the traditional paper-based application process, providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly platform for candidates, administrators, and stakeholders.

## Project Overview

## Design Artifacts (Authoritative)

- OpenAPI 3.0 contract: [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml:1)
- Sequence Diagrams (Mermaid): [docs/sequence-diagrams.md](docs/sequence-diagrams.md:1)

These artifacts are normative and must be strictly adhered to during design, implementation, and reviews.

## System Flows

### Registration Flow

#### Step 1: JAMB Verification

- Candidate clicks Apply(from the home screen or login screen) → enters JAMB Reg No (in the Application/registration screen)
- Frontend calls backend to check JAMB number in pre-uploaded dataset
- If exists: Request candidate's Email & Phone Number (if not available in the prelist)
- if exists and complete: the candidate clicks apply
- If not found: Display error and contact admissions office

#### Step 2: Payment Initialization

- Backend creates local Payment record (status=initiated)
- Calls Remita API to initialize Post-UTME payment

#### Step 3: Account Creation

- After successful payment, backend creates Post-UTME account
- Username = JAMB Reg No
- Generates temporary random password (secure, 10-12 chars)
- Sends password to candidate's email with login instructions

#### Step 4-6: Login & Password Management

- Candidate logs in using JAMB Reg No and temporary password
- System prompts password change on first login
- Clear warning to change password

#### Step 7-9: Data Entry

- Biodata Form (pre-filled with JAMB data, additional fields editable)
- Educational Record Form for entry & uploads
- Next-of-kin and Sponsor forms

#### Step 10: Dashboard Access

- Registration Form Preview for review & printing
- Candidate Dashboard with tabs:
  - Payments (view, initiate, print receipts)
  - Admission Letter (view/print if admitted & acceptance fee paid)
  - Biodata (view/edit)
  - SSCE, A-Level, Transcript (uploads)
  - UTME (JAMB result)

### Algorithm & Data Flow Integration

#### 1. Pre-Registration Verification Flow

- Dataset from JAMB CAPS uploaded by admin
- Backend maintains `jamb_prelist` table
- Verification against JAMB number on registration

#### 2. Payment Initialization Flow

- Create payment record linked to `jamb_reg_no`
- Call Remita API with orderId, amount, purpose
- Save `remita_rrr` & status=initiated
- Webhook verification success → update status=paid, trigger account creation

#### 3. Account Creation Flow

- Username = JAMB Reg No
- Password = secureRandom(12) (hashed in DB)
- Email with login details & force password change

#### 4. Matric Number Generation (Post-Admit)

- Triggered when admission status = admitted
- Requires acceptance_fee & school_fee payment
- Calls matric generator algorithm

### Payment Flow

#### Recommended Pattern

1. **Payment Initiation**: Candidate clicks pay → frontend calls backend
2. **Payment Record Creation**: Backend creates local Payment record (status=initiated)
3. **Provider Integration**: Calls payment provider API (Primarily Remita)
4. **User Payment**: User completes payment on provider UI or inline modal
5. **Webhook Processing**: Payment provider sends webhook to backend
6. **Verification**: Webhook handler verifies provider signature
7. **Status Update**: Updates Payment status to success/failed
8. **Reconciliation**: Queues job to reconcile and send receipt
9. **Final Validation**: Worker validates payment with provider's verify API
10. **Process Completion**: Updates Application status or triggers downstream processes

#### Resilience & UX Improvements

- Clear progress UI and guidance for failed payments
- Polling + webhook combination to reduce user uncertainty
- Idempotency keys on initialize calls to avoid double-charging
- Automatic retries and manual dispute resolution in admin panel

### Matriculation & Auto-Account Provisioning

#### Business Rules

- When candidate status becomes "Admitted" and fees are paid
- Generate matric number using university format (e.g., FUEP/2025/CSC/0123)
- Create Student record and provision portal account

#### Auto-Provisioning Steps

1. Generate matric number according to agreed algorithm
2. Create Student record linking Candidate
3. Provision portal account with username = matric_no
4. Temporary password or OTP flow
5. Force password reset on first login
6. JAMB number as secondary recovery field (not password)

## Technical Implementation

### Document Upload & Validation

- **File Restrictions**: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG formats
- **Size Limits**: 5-10MB depending on document type
- **Security**: Virus/malware scan (ClamAV or commercial)
- **Processing**: Background workers for conversion and normalization
- **Storage**: Generate thumbnails for admin previews
- **Audit**: Store checksum and original file metadata

### Admin Tools & Operational Flows

- **Bulk Operations**: CSV upload with schema matching and preview
- **Candidate Management**: Filter candidates, view candidates, update candidate's information(including password) and delete candidates
- **Payment Management**: view, filter, Create, update and delete payment types, amount, and other relevant informations
- **Payment Resolution**: Dispute resolution, manual verification, refunds
- **Batch Processing**: Upload admitted JAMB numbers or selection tools
- **Reporting**: Daily counts, success rates, statistics, exports
- **Audit**: Immutable audit logs for key actions

### Security & Compliance Checklist

- **Transport**: TLS everywhere, HSTS
- **Validation**: Server-side input validation, strict content-type checks
- **Protection**: Rate limiting, brute-force protection on auth endpoints
- **Encryption**: Strong hashing (argon2/bcrypt), sensitive data encryption
- **Verification**: Webhook verification for payment providers
- **Testing**: Regular vulnerability scans and pen testing
- **Access Control**: RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- **Backup Security**: Backup encryption and key management

### Operational Considerations

#### Backup Strategy

- **Database**: Nightly pg_dump with WAL archiving
- **Retention**: 30 days on cloud, replicate to local server nightly
- **Files**: Sync to cloud and nightly replication to on-prem storage
- **Testing**: Annual disaster recovery testing

#### Local Backup Strategy

- Local server as cold standby
- Documented failover procedures
- Maintain operational readiness

### Deployment & CI/CD

- **Repository**: GitHub/GitLab with branch protection rules
- **CI Pipeline**: Test → build → deploy to staging using GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: IaC (Terraform) for provisioning
- **Deployment**: Blue/green or rolling deployments

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Backend and frontend (60-80% coverage on critical modules)
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, payment provider mocks
- **End-to-End**: Cypress/Playwright for major flows
- **Performance**: Load testing before admissions window

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics**: Request rates, latency, error rates
- **Alerting**: Payment webhook failures, DB errors, high error rates
- **Health Checks**: Endpoints and synthetic monitoring
- **Critical Flows**: Payment initiation to verification monitoring
