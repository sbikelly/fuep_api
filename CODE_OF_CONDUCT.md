# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming and inclusive environment. All participants are expected to follow these guidelines:

- Be respectful and professional.
- Do not harass or discriminate against others.
- Assume good intent and try to resolve conflicts constructively.
- Follow project maintainersâ€™ direction and feedback.

Reports of unacceptable behavior may be sent confidentially to the maintainers listed in CODEOWNERS or via the process in SECURITY.md. Consequences for behavior that violates this Code of Conduct may include a warning, temporary or permanent ban from participation, or other actions deemed appropriate by the maintainers.
