# Development Status

## Current Phase: Phase 7 - Payment Gateway Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: All payment gateway integration features have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.

## Phase 7 Deliverables Status

### ‚úÖ Database Schema Extension

- Enhanced `payments` table with provider fields, metadata, and audit trail
- Added `payment_events` table for comprehensive state change tracking
- Enhanced `receipts` table with content hash for tamper detection
- Added `v_payment_summary` view for candidate payment lookup

### ‚úÖ Payment Provider Architecture

- Implemented `IPaymentProvider` interface for provider-agnostic operations
- Created provider registry and factory pattern for dynamic provider management
- Provider configuration management with environment variable support

### ‚úÖ Remita Integration (Primary Provider)

- Payment initialization with RRR (Remita Retrieval Reference) generation
- Webhook signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- Payment status mapping and verification logic
- Sandbox mode support for development and testing

### ‚úÖ Flutterwave Integration (Fallback Provider)

- Payment initialization with unique transaction reference generation
- Webhook signature verification using HMAC-SHA256
- Payment status mapping and verification logic
- Sandbox mode support for development and testing

### ‚úÖ Payment Service Layer

- Idempotency key generation and enforcement for payment operations
- Provider selection and fallback logic for high availability
- Webhook processing and payment state updates
- Receipt generation and storage management

### ‚úÖ API Endpoints

- `POST /payments/init` - Payment initiation with provider selection
- `GET /payments/:id` - Payment status and details retrieval
- `POST /payments/:id/verify` - Manual payment verification
- `GET /payments/:id/receipt` - Receipt generation and download
- `POST /payments/webhook/remita` - Remita webhook processing
- `POST /payments/webhook/flutterwave` - Flutterwave webhook processing
- `GET /payments/providers/status` - Provider health monitoring

### ‚úÖ Security & Reliability

- Webhook signature verification using cryptographic HMAC validation
- Timestamp validation and replay protection mechanisms
- Strict idempotency enforcement for payment operations
- Structured logging for comprehensive payment event tracking

### ‚úÖ Documentation & Types

- Enhanced shared types for all payment operations
- Updated OpenAPI specification with new endpoints
- Comprehensive environment variable configuration
- Provider setup and configuration instructions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture

- **Provider Pattern**: Clean abstraction layer hiding provider-specific implementation details
- **Registry Pattern**: Centralized provider management with dynamic initialization
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separation with clear responsibilities
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive audit trail for all payment state changes

### Security Features

- **Signature Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 validation for all webhook payloads
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate payment processing
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp validation prevents webhook replay attacks
- **Audit Trail**: Complete payment event logging for compliance and debugging

### Database Design

- **Normalized Schema**: Efficient payment data storage with proper indexing
- **Audit Trail**: `payment_events` table tracks all state transitions
- **Receipt Storage**: Secure receipt generation with tamper detection
- **Performance**: Optimized indexes for payment queries and reporting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up Remita and Flutterwave sandbox credentials
2. **Webhook Testing**: Test webhook endpoints with provider sandbox environments
3. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end payment flow validation
4. **Security Review**: Penetration testing of webhook endpoints

### Future Enhancements

1. **Production Deployment**: Move from sandbox to production credentials
2. **Monitoring**: Implement payment success/failure rate monitoring
3. **Reconciliation**: Automated payment status reconciliation jobs
4. **Analytics**: Payment analytics and reporting dashboard

## Summary

Phase 7 has been successfully completed with a comprehensive payment gateway integration system. The implementation provides:

1. **Real Payment Processing**: Integration with Remita (primary) and Flutterwave (fallback)
2. **Security**: Webhook signature verification, idempotency, and audit trails
3. **Reliability**: Provider fallback, comprehensive error handling, and state management
4. **Scalability**: Clean architecture supporting additional payment providers
5. **Compliance**: Audit trails and tamper detection for financial operations

The system is ready for development testing and can be deployed to production after proper credential configuration and security validation.
